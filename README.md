# Chess
This is a simple game of chess for two alternating players on a single computer.
It will be coded in Python by Raheem, David, Bella, and Emmanual.
The controls will be very simple. When you click on a chess
piece you will be presented with the options for movement.
You can then select one of these to finalize your move, or select a different piece to view its options.
